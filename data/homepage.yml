  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My passion is science</strong>, a combination of biology, math, and coding. 
    But, when I am not doing research or building software, I enjoy riding my mountain bike to connect with Nature.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus</strong> is applying Data Science and Machine Learning to genomics and medicine. 
    I create value for biologists and medical scientists by bridging static bioinformatics with falsifiable dynamic mechanistic modeling. 
    I enjoy learning, working with biomedical practitioners, and making better decisions based on data.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My computer-aided technology</strong> is developing innovative probabilistic data-fusion pipelines to improve data interpretation. 
    Genomic data interpretation and modeling may begin, for example, with NGS WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing) / WES (Whole Exome Sequencing)
    analysis of genomic makeups of complex diseases followed by computer-aided reconstruction of gene-regulatory circuits, signaling networks, and metabolic pathways. 
    Subsequent analysis of top-level models may further predict potential Darwin's irreversible or Lamarckian's reversible mutations.  
    </p>    
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>Success stories</strong> include, for example, one substantial accomplishment based on mechanistic reconstruction of PD1/PDL1 genetic regulation in inflammation,
    which explained why melanoma-tumor growth progression would accelerate in patients with infectious diseases, including flu.
